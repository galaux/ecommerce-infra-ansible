- [Issue list](https://gitlab.com/galaux/shop-ami-user-data/issues)


TODO
----

- run mysql script that removes test db
- backup results of mysqltuner etc to S3
- report install of php56-pecl-acpu to ansible (do not forget that this must be enabled in PS backend … but this should be backuped by our DB dump)
- see deactivation of apache engine in php.ini
- Nginx optimisation
  - See this [Nginx tweak guide](https://tweaked.io/guide/nginx/)
    - see "client caching"
    - see "Tuning for PHP"
    - as advised, installer APC (see about that. Aren't there as many advice NOT to do so?)
  - Compare our Nginx conf with [official suggestion](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/docs/server_config/nginx.conf.dist)
  - [If need to optimize Nginx some more](https://linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/configure-nginx-for-optimized-performance/)
- decrease backup script verbosity and/or configure logrotate with compression
- Create ansible "users" and update
  - monit conf (user email addresses)
  - create nominated accounts "owner" and "galaux" for mysql?
  - set these users in the htpasswd
- See if possible to change the mysql parameter 40xxxx to sthing like "40M"
- enhance CloudFormation with [Grouping and Labeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudformation-interface.html)
- enable setup of any `*.shop.company` instance with automatic Route53 DNS creation/update!
- remove `lineinfile` option `backrefs` and rather use sthing such as `"^#?compress"` instead of `"^#compress"`
- optionally add collectd `collectdctl` config: `LoadPlugin unixsock` to be able to `collectdctl  getval test.example.com/df-root/df_complex-used`
